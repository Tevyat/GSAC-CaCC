## ASK

"The customer is always right, in matters of taste." This quote though popularized during the 1990s, is still passed around to this day, especially in industries where customer satisfaction can make or break a business. Within the aviation industry, the satisfaction of the passengers plays big role in shaping the reputation of an airline. This case study looks at these reviews to find patterns in what passengerâ€™s value most and how airlines can improve their services. Specifically, this case study hopes to answer the following questions:

* What factors (Seat Comfort, Staff Service, Food & Beverages, etc.) have the most significant impact on the overall rating of the passenger?
* How do ratings vary based on the month that passenger flew?
* Are there periods where airlines underperform in specific categories?
* Do ratings vary significantly between people flying for leisure (solo or with family) and those flying for business?
* Which traveler type reports the highest satisfaction?
* Are there differences in satisfaction between airlines? Which airlines are rated highest or lowest?
